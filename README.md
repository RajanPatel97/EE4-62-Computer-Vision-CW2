# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-for-Synthetic-Image-Generation
We present an exploration into the generation of synthetic handwritten digit images using Generative Adversarial Networks  (GANs). We endeavour to generate synthetic images that are in- distinguishable from real images, thus qualitative, and quantitative measures such as the Inception Score are endorsed to assess the quality and diversity of generated images. We endeavour to find an optimal approach that maximises the Inception Score, by taking into consideration preprocessing steps, training procedures and the configuration of hyperparameters for various GAN architectures.
